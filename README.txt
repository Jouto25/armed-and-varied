Armed and Varied is a mod that adds more tiers of tools and armor, alongside updating some early gear to make adventuring in Minecraft a little more smoother.


Full Breakdown:

Four new tiers of tools and armor await you!

* Copper A tier between stone and iron, though less enchantable than iron.
* Amethyst A tier between iron and emerald. Go adventuring in style!
* Emerald A tier between amethyst and diamond. Slay the monsters with the currency of the villagers!
* Rose Gold A tier of its own. With the strength of diamond tools and armor, it’s a quick and stylish fix to keep you on top of any foe that dares to cross your path!

Overhauled Leather and Chainmail recipes!

* Leather armor has been changed so it is more easier to acquire early game.  To make leather armor, you’ll need to turn leather into leather scraps.

* Chainmail armor also has crafting recipes. Use iron nuggets to get chainmail armor quickly!

New Horse Armor and More!

* New Rose Gold, Copper, Amethyst, Emerald, and Netherite Horse Armors!

* All Horse Armors are craftable now!


Other Rose Gold items and blocks for you to use!
* Rose Gold Blocks! Make a palace with this beautiful block!
* Rose Gold Apple A tier between Gold and Enchanted Gold Apples! Gives Regeneration, Absorption, and Fire Resistance!
* Rose Gold Carrot A greater version of the Gold Carrot. It will give more saturation and restore more hunger than regular golden carrots!


**Future Plans**:
* Port to Fabric (1.21.1) and NeoForge (1.21.1)
